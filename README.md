# dl-tutorials
This repo is intended to teach me modern deep learning algorithms.
Each sub directory is a specific tutorial.

## Installation

Make a virtual env with the right packages, and set up the git commit hooks

```
pip install -e ./
pre-commit install
```

(or uv)


## Design

Do Repeat Yourself: since each tutorial is intended as a stand
alone teaching example, I intentionally repeat code for readability.
